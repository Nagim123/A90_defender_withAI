# A90_defender_withAI
The aim of the project is to help people to reach A-1000 room in doors by using AI model that detects A90 attacks and blocks player from moving.

1. and by the way it is not working because when you move and it detects A90, then it block input but in game you are still moving forward
2. If you manage to fix it, you can use it easily. Everything is working good (model, screen scanning etc)
3. Use my code and finish the work, because I'm very lazy
